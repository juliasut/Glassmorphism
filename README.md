# Glassmorphism
Glass morphism is a relatively new UI design trend.

In this project, I learned how to build a credit card that looks like frosted glass and is actually a fillable form with simple validation.

Easing animation function is from easings.net

For the validation, a JavaScript library called Cleave.js was used.
